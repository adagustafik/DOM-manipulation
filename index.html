<h1>
 Make More Than One List 
</h1>
<h2>
  You shouldn't have just one to-do list.
</h2>
<p>
  Don't hold back. Make lists for everything you think of! The useful ones will stick around. You can scrap any that end up not being useful to you. 
</p>
<h2>
  Some other ideas are:
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Shopping
    <ol type= "I">
      <li>
        bananas
      </li>
      <li>
        broccoli
      </li>
      <li>
        soy sauce
      </li>
      <li>
        eggplant
      </li>
      <li>
        peppers
      </li>
      <li>
        ciabatta
      </li>
      <li class="blue">
        rice, white
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Someday (where you write down unimportant tasks that you might do someday)
  </li>
  <li>
    Weekend (for anything you want to do on the weekend but don't want to be distracted by during the week), and
  </li>
  <li>
    Chores for Kids.
  </li>
</ul>
